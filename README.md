A prototype system. NCNU BigData lecture project.

## Data collecting:

1. Parse article from news site. Extract data.

3. Import to DB (RethinkDB)
4. Build geospatial index (RethinkDB or Redis)

## User Stream:

1. Locate user (GPS, map center)
2. Get radius (map size)
3. Send location to server, get unsorted array of Entries { [Keywords], timestamp, source, etc}
4. Build and show Keyword Cloud on map.
5. Repeat.

## Keyword Score
- Algorithm: sum(1/timeDiff)
  - timeDiff = epoch(now) - epoch(timestamp)
  - score = 1 / (timeDiff / 86400 / 30)
- Test dataï¼š
  - timestamp: random in 2007/1/1..2017/1/1

# Nearby News API Server

## Overview
Server template was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server.

This server uses the [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) middleware layer for Node.js.
This service uses [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/) Database.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
